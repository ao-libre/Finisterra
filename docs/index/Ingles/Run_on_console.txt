====== Run on console ======

* Option A: Use this command in CMD or TERMINAL to clone repository

git clone https://github.com/ao-libre/ao-java.git

* Option B: Download https://github.com/ao-libre/ao-java/archive/master.zip
* Option C: Clone this repository https://github.com/ao-libre/ao-java.git with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
### Step 2. Run on console
#### Windows:
* Use CMD for run
   1. Go to folder /ao-java and use following commands to run client on console gradlew.bat desktop:run -x :shared:fluid** or server gradlew.bat server:run
#### Linux o Mac    
* Use TERMINAL for run
   1. Go to folder /ao-java and use following commands to run client on console ./gradlew desktop:run -x :shared:fluid** or server ./gradlew server:run

** To avoid recompiling shared module and regeneration of .class files, which will probably bring some execution errors like ClassNotFoundException, you can add this argument to skip `fluid` task in both client and server run configurations: -x :shared:fluid

### Conflicts running Client and Server in same machine
- If occurred error on ***Windows***, test this command gradlew.bat desktop:build or server gradlew.bat server:build before repeat [step i](#windows).
- If occurred error on ***Linux or Mac*** , test this command ./gradlew desktop:build or server ./gradlew server:build before repeat [step i](#linux-o-mac).

### Generate distribution jars:
This step is not necessary, use it only if you want to create an executable to share with a friend.  ./gradlew desktop:dist   ./gradlew server:dist
