Rewriting Argentum Online in Java, using Artemis, Kryonet and libGDX.

## ECS (entity-component-system)
To understand ECS, I recommend to read [this](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/Introduction-to-Entity-Systems).
Using [artemis](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) framework has been really useful to start rewriting this game.

## Kryonet
Avoid creating huge game protocol since we can use Requests and Responses, which can be processed easily with 'visitor' design pattern. 
Read more [here](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet)

## libGDX
It allows us to create application game logic, create screens and render all that we need using OpenGL.

## Getting Started
### Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ao-libre/ao-java.git
```
## Requirements

Important: you need to use [OpenJDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) to make it run.

### Run
* Go to folder and use following commands to run client ```./gradlew desktop:run``` or server ```./gradlew server:run```
* Or generate distribution jars ``` ./gradlew desktop:dist ``` ``` ./gradlew server:dist ```

### Server
If you want to run server in local machine and don't want to open ports, add following property to VM Options:
* ```-Dserver.useLocalhost=true```

### Conflicts running Client and Server in same machine
To avoid recompiling shared module and regeneration of .class files, which will probably bring some execution errors like ClassNotFoundException, you can add this argument to skip `fluid` task in both client and server run configurations:
* ```-x :shared:fluid```

### Import in IntelliJ
* Select 'Import Project'
* Find and select ```build.gradle``` file
* Create run configurations using gradle tasks (desktop:run, server:run)

Here is an image showing how it should look like:

#### How to change Java Version?
If you have another version of Java already installed, please change: 
https://kodejava.org/how-do-i-set-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-mac-os-x/

If you use IntelliJ, use the JDK that comes with the project if is not working change it by yourself like in the picture below:

`IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle `

## Modules

### components
Contains all components (ECS related) 
### core
Game client logic, screens, GUI, client systems (ECS): on runtime should have a replicated World.
### desktop
Contains assets and desktop game launcher.
### server
Server logic and systems (ECS), database connection (TBD), etc.
### shared
All stuff shared between client and server, like network requests and responses, objects, maps, etc.
